# Hi there! 👋  

I'm a backend developer with 3 years of experience building scalable applications. I specialize in the MERN and PERN stacks, always looking for ways to improve performance and efficiency.  

💼 Currently working at [Fusionix](https://www.fusionix.net/) as a backend developer, implementing Meta’s API and improving a platform that manages user conversations across WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and Telegram.  

🚀 I also collaborate on [TicketSpace](https://ticketspace.com.ar/) as a backend developer, using MERN and Fastify to enhance the platform.  

🛠️ Founder of [Stable Software](https://stable.com.ar/), where I develop custom software solutions tailored to each client’s needs.  

⚙️ Passionate about DevOps! I work with Docker, Azure services, and both Linux and Windows Server virtual machines to ensure smooth deployments and high availability.
